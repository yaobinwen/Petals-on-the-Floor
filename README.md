# Petals on the Floor

This repository is my collection of wonderful books, articles, movies, paintings, and perhaps any kind of art, as well as my own thoughts.

I've been using [_豆瓣_](https://www.douban.com/) and [_goodreads_](https://www.goodreads.com/) for a long time. They are good web services because of the built-in social functions, but sometimes I feel they still don't meet my needs quite well. For example, _豆瓣_ is better at Chinese books while _goodreads_ at non-Chinese books, but I read in both languages so sometimes I can't find the books I'm reading, and adding the new books is a hassle that I'm not interested in handling (though I did a few times before). In addition, I want to put all my thoughts or reviews about the books in one place for easier reference. Furthermore, I always have the concern that what if one day the service has to be shut down, and they don't seem to provide a function to export all the stuff I've created.

So I decided to maintain my own public repository for the same purpose. And here it is.

I read in both Chinese and English, so I also write in both.
